## Gen Notes
- open note/book etc...
- 

## Linux/Bash/WSL
- Bash (Bourne Again Shell) is a shell & and scripting langauge 
- The shell is used to talk to the machine/computer
- WSL gives you a Linux environment on a Windows machine


## Commands:
`$ pwd` \
- "print working directory" \
`/home/kris` \
- root or home is normal, root is commonly reused by linux \
`$ cd /` \
- goes to the root file system, '/' is the root \
`/` \
`$ ls -al` \
- shows all files, even hidden ones, ll does the same for me \
- '-' is an indicator for a switch command (modifies the output), 'a' stands for all files, 'l' stands for long format \
- hidden files are files that have a dot (.) in front of them \
`$ touch xyz` \
- creates a new file \
`$ ls -a /` \
- shows all the files at the root. \

## Linux Directory Structure:
1. / (Root Directory):
- At the apex of the directory hierarchy lies the root directory denoted by a forward slash (/). It serves as the starting point for all other directories and files in the system. Essential system files, configuration files, and directories critical for system operation reside here.
2. /bin (Binary Binaries):
- The /bin directory contains essential executable binaries (programs) fundamental to the operation of the system. Common system utilities and commands such as ls, cp, mkdir, and rm are stored here. These binaries are accessible to all users.
3. /sbin (System Binaries):
- Similar to /bin, the /sbin directory houses essential system binaries, but these binaries are typically reserved for administrative tasks and require elevated privileges (root access) for execution. Utilities related to system administration, such as ifconfig and fdisk, are stored here.
4. /etc (Etcetera):
- The /etc directory stores system-wide configuration files and settings. Configuration files for various system services, network settings, user authentication, and package management are located here. It's a crucial directory for system administrators for customizing and maintaining system behavior.
5. /home (Home Directories):
- Each user on a Linux system typically has a dedicated directory within /home where their personal files, documents, settings, and user-specific configuration files reside. For example, the home directory for the user "john" would be /home/john.
6. /var (Variable):
- The /var directory contains variable data files that are expected to grow or change in size during normal system operation. Logs, spool files, cached data, and other variable files generated by system services, applications, and users are stored here.
7. /tmp (Temporary):
- The /tmp directory serves as a temporary storage location for files that are only needed for a short duration. Temporary files, caches, and scratch files created by various programs and scripts are stored here. The contents of this directory are typically cleared upon system reboot.
8. /dev (Devices):
- The /dev directory contains special device files that represent hardware devices and peripherals connected to the system. These device files provide an interface for interacting with hardware components such as disks, terminals, printers, and more.
9. /proc (Process):
- The /proc directory is a virtual file system that provides information about currently running processes and system resources. It contains a series of numbered directories and special files that represent running processes, kernel parameters, and system status.
10. /mnt (Mount):
- The /mnt directory serves as a mount point for temporarily mounting external storage devices such as USB drives, network shares, and external disks. When a device is mounted, its contents become accessible within the /mnt directory structure.
