- The shell is used to talk to the machine/computer


## Commands:
`$ pwd` \
"print working directory" \
`/home/kris` \
root or home is normal, root is commonly reused by linux \
`$ cd /` \
goes to the root file system, '/' is the root \
`/` \
`$ ls -al` \
shows all files, even hidden ones, ll does the same for me \
'-' is an indicator for a switch command (modifies the output), 'a' stands for all files, 'l' stands for long format \
hidden files are files that have a dot (.) in front of them \
`$ touch xyz` \
creates a new file \
`$ ls -a /` \
shows all the files at the root. \
